SPECTRE: Short packet communication toolbox
===========================================

Shannon theory describes fundamental limits of communication and compression systems. Classic closed-form results (such as the well known log(1 + SNR) formula) apply only to the regime of infinite blocklength (infinite packet size/ infinite delay). 

For finite blocklengths, no closed-form results are usually obtainable, but there exist tight upper and lower bounds on fundamental limits, as well as approximations. This repository provides  numerical routines to compute these bounds and these approximations for some popular channel and source models.


Content
--------------------

Achievability bounds, converse bounds and approximation for the following channel models:

* AWGN channel
* Quasi-static fading channel
* Rayleigh block-fading channel (no CSI)
