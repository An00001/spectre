Functions in this directory:
0. overview:
	* see plot_v3.m for an example of calling and plotting results

1. ach
	* shannon_ach2.m: Shannon FBL achievability
	  power constraint: maximal (aka short term)
	  probability of error: maximal 

	  comments: This is RCU bound with purging to get maximal Pe.

	* kappa.m (or kappa_inf.m, which is a fast approximation) together with
	  betaq_up_v2.m compute kappa-beta bound for AWGN (with CAOD for Q_Y)

	* gallager_ach.m and feinstein_approx.m

2. conv 
	* betaq_low_v2.m
  	  metaconverse with Q_Y = N(0, 1+P). Maximal prob. of error
 	  power constraint: equal (all codewords on the sphere)
	  probability of error: average

	  Note: script is called betaq_low_v2.m because it tries to output
	  the best lower bound on beta (since we are computing converse).

	* wolfowitz.m 
	  wolfowitz converse (just another lower bound on beta).

3. normapx
	* normal approximation is computed as 
		 n*cap_awgn(A) - k_awgn(A, epsilon)*sqrt(A) + log(n)/2

4. universe/
	generate universe plots + the database of codes
	main files: plot_universe.m or plot_universe_db.m
