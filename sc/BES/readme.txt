This folder contains the numerical evaluation of the bounds in [*] for the binary erasured source. 
In this setting, a source with bias p is observed by the encoder through an erasure channel with erasure probability alpha.
The goal is to reconstruct the source under the bit error rate constraint. 

The code uses auxiliary functions contained in lib/. This directory can to be added to Matlab path by running the following command: path(path, '../../lib’).
